Module to create a markov chain text generator using an input string of data

V 0.2
Created function to take in a string of data and generate a dictionary of words to be used in a Markov chain generator
Created function to take in a dictionary of words:following words to generate text.

V 0.3
Expanded the data structure to support weighted probabilities based on how many times a word is followed by a second
